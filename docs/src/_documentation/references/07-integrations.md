## [Navigation](#navigation)

mrujs supports both Turbolinks and Turbo for navigation of remote forms
and remote links. It is designed to not overwrite similar functionality of Turbo.

## [Form Errors](#form-errors)

Mrujs also uses the popular Morphdom library to DOM diff form submission errors from the server.

## [CableCar](#cablecar)

Mrujs has a first-class plugin for CableCar, the popular CableReady
operation serializer.

To read about how to integrate CableCar, check out the documentation on
it!

## [Using with other Frameworks](#using-with-other-frameworks)

Rails isn't for everyone and isn't for everything! Although mrujs is
designed to work best with Rails, its a purely frontend library that
will work with any backend of your choice. There is one small hiccup
in regards to redirects, to learn more, checkout the
[Understanding method masking](/references/understanding-method-masking)
section.
